        "\n",
        "### Background\n",
        "Suspect profiling, also known as criminal profiling, is a technique used in criminal investigations for nearly a century to identify potential suspects based on various psychological, behavioral, and demographic characteristics. Dr. Walter C. Langer, a psychiatrist, was commissioned by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) to profile [Adolf Hitler](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/cia-rdp78-02646r000600240001-5), marking one of the earliest known attempts at profiling in the 1940s. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Goal\n",
        "Showcasing the creation of a comprehensive suspect profile leveraging browser history, a digital footprint that offers valuable insights into an individual's thoughts, interests, and behaviors. \n",
        "\n",
        "- Identify the individual's age  \n",
        "- Determine individual's interests\n",
        "- Estimate the individual's location \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dataset in this study\n",
        "- Browser history is donated by a volunteer \n",
        "    - as a demo with not necessary related to criminal behaviors \n",
        "    - we can evaluate the accuracy \n",
