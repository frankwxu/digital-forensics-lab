Ali Qaddafiddam had failed in efforts to recruit fighters among the\\nEgyptian population living immediately across the border with Libya.\\nThese individuals added that during the week of February 21 the Libyan Leader spoke to Syrian\\nPresident Bashir al-Assad on at least three occasions by secure telephone lines. During the\\nconversations Qaddafi asked that Syrian officers and technicians currently training the Libyan\\nAir Force be placed under command of the Libyan Army and allowed to fight against the rebel\\nforces.\\n(Source Comment: Senior Libyan Army officers still loyal to Qaddafi added that On February\\n23, President Assad told General Isam Hallaq, the commander in chief of the Syrian Air Force,\\nto instruct the pilots and technicians in Tripoli to help the Libyan regime, should full scale Civil\\nWar breaks out in the immediate future.)\\nOn March 2, a military officer with ties to Qaddfi's son Khamis stated privately that the number\\nof Libyan pilots defecting to the opposition has destroyed the morale and professional spirit of\\nthe Libyan Air Force at this critical moment, when Tripoli's air superiority is its principal weapon\\nagainst insurgents. In the opinion of this individual Qaddafi and his senior military advisors are\\nconvinced that the European Union and the U.S will impose a no-fly zone over Libya in the\\nimmediate future. These advisors believe that the no fly zone will serve as air support for\\nopposition forces. They are also prepared for the Western allies to bomb anti-aircraft facilities in\\nand around Tripoli in preparation for the establishment of the no-fly zone. Foreign Minister\\nMousa Kousa is convinced that that Russia and Turkey will oppose the move, and may prevent\\nthe implementation of the no fly zone.\\nThe Syrian soldiers in Libya are part of a mission established in 1984 following the signing of a\\nmilitary agreement between Qaddafi and Syria's long-time ruler and Bashir's father, Hafez al-\\nAssad, in the presence of General Soubhi Haddad, who was the commander in chief of the Air\\nForce at the time.

Libyan money\\nhelped Hafez al-Assad bribe his brother Rifaat, the author of an attempted coup d'etat in 1983,\\nto leave the country and go into exile in Spain and France, where he has remained ever since.\\nAccording to individuals with access to the Syrian military, Damascus has also sent a second\\nteam of pilots and technicians to Tripoli. These are lower-ranking officers loyal to the regime\\nwho are specialized in flying helicopters. Before their departure for Tripoli on February 23, they\\nmet with General Allaq and General Jamil Hasan, head of Air Force's Intelligence.\\n(Source Comment: During the afternoon of 3 March, an associate of Saif al-Islam Qaddafi\\nstated that he and the Libyan leaders other family members were concerned over the\\nannouncement of Jose Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal\\nCourt (ICC), announced that he was investigating Qaddafi, his sons Khamis, the commander of\\nthe 32 battalion, and Montasem, as well as the head of Gadhafi's personal security detail, the\\nDirector-General of the External Security Organization (Abuzaid Dorda), the spokesman of the\\nregime (Musa Ibrahim), and the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Mousa Kousa). This source added\\nthat Saif al-Islam had said that Qaddafi himself found the announcement amusing.)\\nFrom: Lord Owen\\nCody,\\nRealistically the UN will not authorise a no fly zone while Gaddafi continues to hold off bombing and\\nstrafing but keeping it up front and on the military agenda keeps him worried. Yet for a few frustrating months\\nthat ambivalence kept the Serbian aeroplanes on the ground before we acted. My hope is that preparations\\ncontinue with visuals of planes flying off carriers, airborne early warning planes flying and people with clout\\noutside the Administration demanding preparations. But and it is a big BUT what else can and should we be\\ndoing? Encourage humanitarian ships and convoys from Egypt to bring in supplies since we must ensure the\\ncities in the East can hold up living standards, maybe for months. More adventurous, Egyptian Special Forces to\\ngo in and advise, even supplying hand held missiles. It appears they have few missiles; the military in the East\\nhaving been deliberately kept ill-equipped. There is old Nasserite sentiment for a Federation of Egypt, Sudan\\nand Libya. I know some will say Egypt has enough problems and they should stay resolutely focused on\\ndomestic reforms. it is delicate but words alone and the balance of advantage will slip to Gaddafi. A Gaddafi\\nvictory is possible and needs to be weighed in the balance now when deciding what to do.\\nI'm more worried than I am ready to say publicly.\\nYours\\nDavid\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739546\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

During the\\nconversations Qaddafi asked that Syrian officers and technicians currently training the Libyan\\nAir Force be placed under command of the Libyan Army and allowed to fight against the rebel\\nforces.\\n(Source Comment: Senior Libyan Army officers still loyal to Qaddafi added that On February\\n23, President Assad told General Isam HaIlaq, the commander in chief of the Syrian Air Force,\\nto instruct the pilots and technicians in Tripoli to help the Libyan regime, should full scale Civil\\nWar breaks out in the immediate future.)\\nOn March 2, a military officer with ties to Qaddfi's son Khamis stated privately that the number\\nof Libyan pilots defecting to the opposition has destroyed the morale and professional spirit of\\nthe Libyan Air Force at this critical moment, when Tripoli's air superiority is its principal weapon\\nagainst insurgents.

And now, because of this tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more\\nfriends to mourn.\\nChris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching English in Morocco. He joined\\nthe Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America in distant places, and made other people\\'s hopes his\\nown.\\nIn the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition. He arrived on a cargo\\nship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with Libya\\'s revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a\\ntyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his\\nsister, Ann, this morning, and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.\\nSean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer in the State Department,\\nhe was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather,\\nwith whom I spoke this morning. He was a father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being\\nproud of the service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and finally to\\nBenghazi.\\nThe mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary, and we arid the people\\nof Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy. Today, many Americans are asking indeed, I asked\\nmyself — how could this happen? How could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from\\ndestruction? This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be\\nBut we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group — not the people or\\nGovernment of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a country scarred by war and tyranny, they were\\nhailed as friends and partners. And when the attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post, Some\\nwere wounded. Libyans carried Chris\\' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to safety.\\nAnd last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the violence and pledged every effort\\nto protect our people and pursue those responsible.\\nThe friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty of this attack. A free\\nand stable Libya is still in America\\'s interest and security, and we will not turn our back on that nor will we rest until\\nthose responsible for these attacks are found and brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities\\nto move swiftly and surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American embassies,\\nconsulates, and citizens.\\nThere will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher priority than protecting our\\nmen and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine the precise motivations and methods of those who\\ncarried out this assault. Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our\\nEmbassy in Cairo yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet. America\\'s commitment to\\nreligious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear —there is no justification for this,\\nnone. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long as there are those who would take innocent life\\nin the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace.\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739562\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

On September 12, 2012 Libyan President Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf\\ntold senior advisors that the death of the U.S. Ambassador at the hands of Islamist\\nmilitia forces represents a threat to the future of the newly elected General National\\nCongress (GNC) Government. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf\\nbelieves that the primary goal of this and other attacks on Western facilities is to\\ndemonstrate that the GNC cannot protect its non-Islamic friends. Libyan security\\nofficials believe that the attack was carried out by forces of the Islamist militia\\ngroup calling itself the Ansar al Sharia brigade; working out of camps in the\\nEastern suburbs of Benghazi. These officials added that their sources indicate that\\nthis group is led by former members of the old Libyan Islamic Fighting Group\\n(LIFG), some of whom are loyal to Islamist General Abdelhakim Belhaj. The\\nsame officials were quick to point out that they have no evidence that Belhaj had\\nany direct involvement in this attack. They also have no direct information as to\\nwhether this assault has anything to do with the death of Libyan born al Qai'da\\nleader Abu Yahya al- Libi, but they are pursuing this theme. These officials do\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739563\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

According to this source, the immediate events were set in motion by a\\nstatement made by a Muslim Cleric in Egypt saying that the internet film was\\ngoing to be shown across the United States on September 11 in an effort to insult\\nMuslims on the anniversary of the attacks on the New York World Trade Center in\\n2001. This statement inspired increasingly hostile demonstrations at the U.S.\\nEmbassy in Cairo, and at diplomatic facilities in Libya. In Benghazi, reporting\\nfrom security sources states, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia\\nfighters left their base in East Benghazi just after sundown infiltrated the crowd of\\nabout 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These forces, operating under\\ncover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire with\\nrocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El\\nMagariaf ordered security officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that\\nhe had been in touch with Egyptian President Mohm_med Morsi, and the two\\nagreed that their intelligence and security personnel will cooperate in this matter.\\n(Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was\\norganized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence\\nof such a complex operation at this time.\\n3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security\\nofficers also informed el Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for\\napproximately one month, based on casing information obtained during an early\\ndemonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.

These officials add that government security officers\\nadmitted to el Magariaf that they do not have the physical capacity to locate,\\nattack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade, among others. They describe these\\nforces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent time in\\nAfghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and\\nLibyan officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia's are\\nbetter armed than the forces of the new National Army.\\n4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that\\nthe attacks were planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion\\nof the Libyan population is focused on past cooperation between Western\\nintelligence and security services, and the regime of former dictator Muammar al\\nQaddafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.\\nAmbassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to\\ndisarming the militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi\\nbeliefs, and efforts to discredit his government through linking him to Western\\nintelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security officials to cooperate\\nwith their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared for\\nU.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry\\npublic reaction that is sure to follow.\\n5. (Source Comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added that in\\nprivate conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a\\nsenior diplomatic official, foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up\\nnew operations in Libya. According to this sensitive source, el Magariaf believes\\nthat a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced al Qai'da and other\\nradical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739563\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.
