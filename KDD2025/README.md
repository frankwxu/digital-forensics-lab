# Enhancing Digital Forensics Evidence Analysis with Large Language Models

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/BJA_Logo.png" width="150">

## Overview

As the scale and complexity of digital evidence grow in the modern world, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into digital forensics offers a transformative path forward. This three-hour tutorial at KDD 2025 explores how LLMs can be effectively leveraged to automate the analysis of forensic artifacts, extract meaningful patterns from raw data, and support timely, intelligent decision-making in investigations.

Participants will engage in an interactive, hands-on environment that combines practical labs, real-world datasets, and guided exploration of LLM tools. The tutorial covers key applications such as evidence entity recognition, knowledge graph construction from forensic records, and insight extraction from browser activity and sensitive communication datasets.

Designed for researchers, practitioners, and students alike, this session emphasizes both technical rigor and ethical responsibility. By the end of the tutorial, attendees will have a deep understanding of how to deploy LLMs responsibly in forensic workflows, ultimately enhancing justice, transparency, and investigative efficiency in an increasingly data-driven world.
